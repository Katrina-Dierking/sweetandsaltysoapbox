              <img src="" alt="Selena Wampler"/>
              <p>Selena is my daughter-in-law. She was an amazing mom, wife, and daughter.</p>
          
              <p>
              Selena also had a drug addiction she battled for a long time. In 2020, she lost that battle. We tried hard to get her into rehab but the ones with availability wouldn't take her because they didn't take medicaid. We lost her because we couldn't afford to pay for her treatment. 
              </p>
        
              <p>
              I decided then I didn't want that to be the reason anyone lost their loved one. 
              </p>
        
              <p>
              Sweet and Salty Soapbox donates 10% of all profits to a scholarship in Selena's name to help moms battling addiction. We will announce when we are accepting nominations for Selena's Chance recipients.
